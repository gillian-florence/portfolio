# Welcome to My Technical Writing Portfolio

I’m a technical writer with a background in product and systems documentation, focused on making complex information clear, structured, and usable. I’ve worked across hardware, SaaS, and Salesforce-based solutions, awith a strong emphasis on how people actually find, understand, and use documentation.

This site showcases selected documentation samples from my technical writing work.

For a deeper look at my background, experience, and working style, see the [About Me](about-me.md) page.

## About This Site

I built this site to apply docs-as-code workflows in a practical, end-to-end way. I wanted my portfolio to reflect how I work in modern documentation environments—structured, versioned, and designed to evolve.

This project provides a practical space to showcase real documentation using modern documentation tooling.

This site is built using:

- [**Material for MkDocs**](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){: target="_blank" } for static site generation and navigation
- **Visual Studio Code** for local development
- **Markdown** for content authoring
- **YAML** for site configuration and information architecture
- **Git** and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/gillian-florence/mkdocs-material-project){: target="_blank" } for version control and publishing (**GitHub Pages**). 

The result is a living portfolio that supports continuous iteration—both in the documentation itself and in the workflows behind it.
