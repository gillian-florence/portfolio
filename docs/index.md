# Welcome to My Technical Writing Portfolio! 

I’m a technical writer with a background in product and systems documentation, focused on making complex information clear, structured, and usable. I’ve worked across hardware, SaaS, and Salesforce-based solutions, and I care deeply about how people actually find and use documentation.

This site is both a portfolio and a working project. It showcases selected documentation samples, while also reflecting how I like to build, structure, and maintain content.

If you’re looking for a deeper look at my background, experience, and working style, you can find that on my [About Me](about-me.md) page.

## About This Site

I built this site to learn and apply docs-as-code workflows in a real, end-to-end way. Rather than treating my portfolio as a static artifact, I wanted it to reflect how I approach documentation work today—structured, versioned, and designed to evolve over time.

This project focuses on clarity, information architecture, and maintainability, using the same tools and workflows I’d expect to use in a production documentation environment. It also gives me a practical space to showcase real documentation while continuing to build hands-on experience with modern documentation tooling.

This site is built using:

- [**Material for MkDocs**](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){: target="_blank" } for static site generation and navigation
- **Visual Studio Code** for local development
- **Markdown** for writing and content structure
- **YAML** for site configuration and information architecture
- **Git** and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/gillian-florence/mkdocs-material-project){: target="_blank" } for version control and publishing (**GitHub Pages**). 

The result is a living portfolio that supports continuous iteration—both in the documentation itself and in the workflows behind it.
