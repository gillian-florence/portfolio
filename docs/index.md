# Welcome to My Technical Writing Portfolio! 

I’m a technical writer who turns complex systems into clear, usable documentation. I focus on making information easy to find, easy to understand, and easy to use. I like figuring things out and making the complicated feel simple.

Most of my work lives between product, engineering, and the end user — asking questions, testing workflows, and shaping what I learn into practical, no-nonsense guidance. I work closely with teams to understand how things actually work and translate that into straightforward documentation that supports a wide range of users.

This site showcases selected documentation projects for Salesforce-based solutions, including admin guides, help center content, configuration documentation, and product-focused writing.

If you’d like to know more about how I work and what I bring to a team, my [About Me](about-me.md) page offers a deeper look.
