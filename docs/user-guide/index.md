> This excerpt reflects how the guide is delivered to end users in production.

**What this sample represents**  
A focused excerpt from a larger user guide, covering a single feature: **Mass Recurring Non-Availabilities**.

I selected this feature because it reflects real-world user complexity—multiple workflows, configuration-driven behaviour, and Salesforce platform constraints that affect outcomes. Rather than sharing the entire guide, this sample shows how I document one complex feature clearly and thoroughly.

**Audience**  
Dispatchers and operational users working in Salesforce Field Service in a desktop environment. The content assumes familiarity with Salesforce navigation and terminology and focuses on completing tasks accurately and efficiently.

**What this Sample Shows**

- Task-based, procedural writing for complex workflows  
- Clear step sequencing with supporting visuals  
- Explicit handling of edge cases and platform limitations  
- Intentional use of notes to prevent common errors  
- Alignment with Salesforce UI patterns and terminology
