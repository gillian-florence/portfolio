# API Documentation (In Progress)

I’m currently diving into API documentation and developer writing, expanding my skills with hands-on writing, learning best practices, and exploring ways to make this content as clear and useful as possible. My goal isn’t to claim expertise yet, but to show what I’m building and learning along the way.

I’m particularly curious about how **AI-assisted tools** can help generate, maintain, and improve API reference docs, whether that means drafting boilerplate responses or improving consistency across endpoints.

I believe strong documentation is a bridge between developers and users, and I welcome opportunities to collaborate with engineers, product teams, or API providers to build docs that are both technically accurate and user-friendly.
