# Writing Samples
This section includes representative documentation samples from my work on Salesforce-based solutions. Each sample includes a short overview for context and one or more artifacts in PDF and/or MkDocs.

*All documentation samples have been anonymized and adapted for portfolio use. Screenshots and examples are representative and may not reflect exact naming.*

**What to review first**

- **Administrator Guide** – best starting point for evaluating information architecture, configuration documentation, and maintainability across a modular solution.
