# About Me
I’m a technical writer who enjoys making the complex feel simple. I spend my time between product, engineering, and the end user&mdash;testing workflows, asking questions, clarifying intent, and shaping information into guidance people can actually use.

I like figuring things out. More importantly, I enjoy helping people succeed, whether that’s through clear documentation, thoughtful collaboration, or solving a tricky problem alongside a team.

## My Working Environment

??? quote "How I Work"
    I work best when I can get hands-on with a product, testing workflows, talking with teammates, and seeing how things actually behave. I’m naturally curious and comfortable working through ambiguity until the picture is clear.

    I’m straightforward and thorough. If something doesn’t make sense, I ask questions until it does, not to challenge anyone, but because accuracy matters.

    I balance collaboration with focused, independent work. I value team discussion and shared problem-solving, but I also need uninterrupted time to dig into details, validate steps, and refine content.

??? quote "What I’m Known For"

    People often describe me as reliable, steady, and easy to work with.

    - **Dependable**  
      If something is assigned to me, it gets done well and on time.

    - **Curious and analytical**  
      I ask why, dig into details, and piece together how things actually work.

    - **Strong communicator**  
      I listen carefully, ask direct questions, and make sure I understand the full context.

    - **Relationship-oriented**  
      I enjoy working with different personalities and learning how teammates operate so collaboration is easier.

??? quote "How I Approach Documentation"
    I write documentation the way people look for information: clear structure, logical flow, and no filler. My focus is on helping users complete tasks without friction.

    I take the time to understand the full workflow, including edge cases, by testing steps myself and asking focused, respectful questions. I don’t assume behaviour without verifying it.

    I tailor content to its audience, keep jargon to a minimum, and maintain documentation as the product evolves. I see documentation as part of the product—it should support adoption, reduce confusion, and build user confidence.

## Skills and Experience
??? quote "General Technical Writing Experience"
    I’ve worked in technical writing roles since 2008, across enterprise hardware, manufacturing environments, SaaS products, and Salesforce-based solutions.

    My experience includes mechanical and electrical installation documentation, operator manuals for in-cab systems, OEM and dealer manuals, knowledge base content, and task-based user guides. While the industries and products have varied, my approach has remained consistent: understand how the system works, observe how people actually use it, and document workflows clearly and accurately for the intended audience.

    - Lucidchart, Draw.io
    - Figma

??? quote "AI in My Writing Workflow"

    I use AI as a practical support tool throughout the documentation lifecycle, not as a replacement for subject-matter expertise.

    In my day-to-day work, I use AI to:
    
    - Accelerate first drafts, outlines, and content restructuring
    - Explore alternative phrasing, tone, or levels of technical depth
    - Sanity-check explanations and surface gaps or assumptions
    - Summarize complex inputs (engineering notes, requirements, feedback)
    - Support consistency across larger documentation sets

    I typicaly prompt for structured summaries or reports so I can review findings systematically—verifying accuracy, deciding what belongs in the documentation, and identifying areas that need deeper investigation.

    Accuracy, context, and judgment always come first. I validate workflows hands-on, confirm details with subject-matter experts, and treat AI output as a starting point.

    Used well, AI helps me work faster and think more clearly, while still delivering documentation that is precise, trustworthy, and aligned with how the product actually works.

??? quote "Intangibles & Strengths"
    These are the qualities that I bring consistently in how I work and how teams experience working with me:

    - Building strong, trusting relationships across product, engineering, UX, and support  
    - Navigating ambiguity and bringing clarity to complex workflows  
    - Taking a detail-oriented, investigative approach to understanding how things really work  
    - Following through with consistency, accountability, and reliability  
    - Balancing collaboration with independent, focused work 
    - Communicating thoughtfully, with a team-first and empathetic mindset

## Work Experience

??? quote "Diabsolut | Technical Writer | January 2023 - Present"
    *Salesforce-based solutions*

    **Overview**  
    I work on Diabsolut’s Product Development team, supporting a Salesforce-based initiative focused on building repeatable, packaged solutions alongside client delivery work. The product development function is a relatively new endeavor within the consulting firm, and I was brought in not only for technical writing, but also for my product management background to help shape how solutions are defined, tested, and documented.

    The team is small and fluid—typically myself, a developer, and rotating support from technical consultants depending on availability. My role is part-time and consulting-based, requiring independence, adaptability, and sound judgment about where to focus effort so the work produces lasting value.

    **What I Do**  
    I work closely with developers, technical consultants, and the Director of Product to document, test, and refine Salesforce-based solutions, primarily focused on Field Service use cases. I own the creation and maintenance of installation guides, configuration documentation, and user-facing content, while also participating actively in product discovery and validation.

    To ensure accuracy, I work hands-on in Salesforce development orgs—configuring objects, fields, flows, permission sets, page layouts, and Lightning components to validate behavior. I test new work items and releases end to end, raise bugs, flag edge cases, and suggest UI/UX improvements based on real admin and end-user workflows. This testing mindset directly informs both the documentation and the product itself. I collaborate closely with developers as features change rapidly, updating content to stay aligned with actual behavior rather than intended design.

    During this time, I have developed a deep understanding of the Salesforce platform and chose to formalize that knowledge by pursuing the Salesforce System Administrator certification. I passed the exam on my first attempt, reinforcing my ability to document Salesforce solutions with credibility, accuracy, and practical insight.

    I also contribute to enablement and product-facing content, including demo scripts, blog posts, and AppExchange-style descriptions, ensuring consistency between how solutions work and how they are communicated.

    **Highlights**  

    - Supported an early-stage Product Development initiative within a Salesforce consulting firm, contributing both technical writing and product-thinking skills.
    - Owned end-to-end documentation for Salesforce-based solutions, from installation and configuration through user workflows.
    - Tested new work items and releases hands-on in Salesforce and contributed to product quality through bug reporting and UX feedback.
    - Built deep Salesforce expertise and earned the Salesforce System Administrator certification on the first attempt.
    - Contributed to documentation, demo scripts, and product-facing content supporting adoption and clarity.

??? quote "Kinduct | Training & Support Specialist to Product Manager | July 2017 – June 2022"


    ??? quote "Training & Support Specialist | July 2017 – August 2018"
        *SaaS -- Athlete Management System*

        **Overview**

        I joined Kinduct, a SaaS-based athlete management platform used by elite sports teams and health organizations, as a Training & Support Specialist. The company was growing quickly, and my role was to take ownership of the knowledge base, improve training content, and bring structure and consistency to documentation supporting a complex, highly configurable product used by a global, high-performance client base.

        **What I Did**

        My first major initiative was a full audit and rebuild of the knowledge base during a significant UI/UX redesign. I learned the platform hands-on across training tools, form builders, injury logs, athlete profiles, admin configuration, reporting, and permissions, and rewrote the entire help center using HTML in Zendesk within my first three months.

        I also documented data workflows and integrations with third-party athlete monitoring tools, translating API-driven processes into clear guidance for non-technical users such as coaches and medical staff.

        As my product knowledge grew, I was asked to take on a hybrid role—leading an Agile development team while continuing to own documentation. In this 50/50 role, I coordinated backlog refinement, sprint planning, and urgent issue response while ensuring documentation stayed aligned with product behaviour.

        During this time, I identified gaps in how the company handled incident communication. After experiencing a reactive outage scenario, I proposed and led the adoption of a structured status and incident communication process, including pre-approved messaging, in-app notification banners, and documented response workflows. This reduced confusion during high-pressure situations and improved client communication.

        **Highlights**

        - Rebuilt the entire knowledge base during a major product modernization effort.  
        - Developed clear, accessible documentation for complex workflows and data integrations.  
        - Took on Agile team leadership while maintaining documentation ownership.  
        - Identified gaps in incident communication and led the adoption of a status page and structured outage-response workflow, including pre-approved messaging, in-app notifications, and documented escalation processes.
        - Built strong cross-functional relationships across product, engineering, and customer success that laid the groundwork for transitioning into a full-time Product Manager role.

    ??? quote "Product Manager | August 2018 – June 2022"

        **Overview**

        I transitioned into a full-time Product Manager role as Kinduct was navigating significant technical and organizational change, including a major platform rebuild and later an acquisition. The platform carried substantial tech debt, and leadership direction shifted more than once. In this environment, my focus was on bringing clarity to ambiguity—helping teams understand what we were building, why it mattered, and how to move forward despite evolving priorities.

        **What I Did**

        I worked closely with senior product leadership, UI/UX designers, customer success, and local and remote engineering teams to define MVPs, gather requirements, and translate complex workflows into actionable user stories and acceptance criteria. This included gathering input from stakeholders, writing user stories and acceptance criteria, shaping backlogs, and supporting two-week release cycles, validating functionality hands-on, and ensuring what we shipped aligned with real client needs.

        My work included supporting major rebuild initiatives, notably the redesign of the Form Builder to support conditional logic for high-profile clients such as the USOPC. The MVP was delivered at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling Kinduct to support use cases previously reliant on external tools like Qualtrics.

        Following Kinduct’s acquisition by mCube (later Movella), the product direction shifted again and another platform rebuild initiative began. Throughout these transitions, I served as a steady point of continuity—coordinating communication across teams, managing incoming client requests, supporting special projects, and helping maintain forward momentum even as long-term strategy evolved.

        **Highlights**

        - Delivered the Form Builder MVP with advanced conditional logic, supporting complex data-collection workflows for elite sport organizations.  
        - Helped guide product direction through multiple rebuild initiatives.  
        - Maintained strong client relationships and incorporated feedback into planning.  
        - Provided stability and clear communication during leadership changes and post-acquisition restructuring.

??? quote "Ultra Maritime | Technical Writer | April 2015 - July 2017"
    *Marine Defence & Manufacturing*  

    **Overview**  
    I joined Ultra Maritime as their first technical writer, supporting engineering teams developing marine defence technology for government and NATO clients. Much of the documentation was authored by technologists and senior engineers, and the review cycles had become inefficient and unsustainable. My role was to improve clarity, consistency, structure, and editorial quality while navigating strict document control and compliance requirements.

    **What I Did**  
    I reviewed and edited a high volume of engineering documentation, standardizing structure, formatting, terminology, and language to align with corporate templates and expectations. This reduced the editing burden on senior engineering leadership and improved document quality earlier in the review process.

    Initially, some engineers were hesitant about introducing a technical writer (editor) into their workflow. I addressed this by clearly defining my role, collaborating closely with authors, and ensuring technical accuracy remained with engineering. Over time, trust improved and the process became smoother.

    As the role evolved, I contributed more directly to procedure-based documentation on the manufacturing floor, supporting a wide range of document types including test plans, test reports, maintenance procedures, specifications, and user manuals. The work required obtaining NATO Secret security clearance and strict adherence to controlled documentation workflows.

    **Highlights** 

    - Served as Ultra Maritime’s first technical writer in a highly regulated environment.  
    - Improved document quality and reduced senior review time.  
    - Supported a broad range of manufacturing and test documentation.  
    - Recognized for attention to detail, efficiency, and contributing to on-time milestone delivery.    
    - Required and held NATO Secret security clearance for defence-related documentation and workflows.  

??? quote "Caterpillar | Technical Writer | July 2008 - March 2015"
    *Mining Technology - Surface Drilling Systems*  

    **Overview**  
    I joined Caterpillar as the first and only technical writer in a small engineering group that had just been acquired. The team worked on mining technology for open-pit operations, including surface drill systems, onboard displays, and integrations used on some of the largest loading and hauling machines in Caterpillar’s fleet. The team was also transitioning from a “garage-style” engineering culture to enterprise-level processes, and almost no formal product documentation existed. My role was to create the entire product documentation set from the ground up while learning Caterpillar’s standards, tools, and publishing practices.

    **What I Did**  
    I worked directly with engineers and designers to understand complex mechanical, electrical, and software systems and translate them into accurate, step-by-step installation and operator documentation. Because products were evolving rapidly, I relied heavily on schematics, assembly drawings, 3D models, and hands-on time in the engineering lab to validate procedures and keep documentation aligned with design changes.

    The work required extreme attention to detail, every manual included full bill of materials, approved part names, and precise installation steps across multiple drill models and configurations. I curated visuals from engineering tools, created original photography, and coordinated closely with Caterpillar’s publishing and safety teams to ensure all content met corporate standards.

    I also validated documentation in the field, travelling to Caterpillar’s Tucson Proving Ground and to mine sites in northern Alberta to observe installations, confirm procedures, and document real-world workflows.

    **Highlights**  

    - Built a complete documentation library from virtually no existing materials.
    - Authored 7+ in-depth installation and operator manuals (100+ pages each).
    - Supported multiple drill models with complex mechanical and electrical variations.
    - Validated procedures on live mine sites and at Caterpillar’s proving grounds.
    - Became a requested writer for additional mining product teams.
