# About Me
I’m a technical writer who enjoys making the complex feel simple. I spend my time between product, engineering, and the end user- testing workflows, asking questions, clarifying intent, and shaping information into guidance people can actually use.

I like figuring things out. More importantly, I like helping people succeed, whether that’s through clear documentation, thoughtful collaboration, or solving a tricky problem alongside a team.

## My Working Environment

??? quote "How I Work"
    I work best when I can get hands-on with products— testing workflows, talking with teammates, and figuring out how things actually behave. I’m naturally curious and don't shy away from ambiguity; I work through it until the picture is clear.

    I’m straightforward, thorough, and persistent. If something doesn’t make sense, I ask questions until it does—not to challenge, but because accuracy matters.

    I balance collaboration with focused, independent work. I like bouncing around ideas with a team, but I also enjoy digging into details on my own to refine content, validate steps, and make things clearer. I’m motivated by progress and by turning complexity into something that makes sense.

??? quote "What I’m Known For"

    People often describe me as reliable, steady, and easy to work with.

    - **Dependable**  
      I take pride in being someone others don’t have to worry about — if something is assigned to me, it gets done well and on time.

    - **Curious & analytical**  
      I’m always asking why, digging deeper, and piecing together how things *actually* work. Curiosity is my engine.

    - **Strong communicator**  
      I listen carefully, ask direct questions, and make sure I understand the full context.

    - **Relationship-builder**  
      I connect naturally with people. I enjoy learning how teammates work, what matters to them, and how I can make their job easier.

??? quote "How I Approach Documentation"
    I write the way people look for information: clear structure, logical flow, and no filler. My goal is always to make the complex usable.

    I dig into the full workflow—including edge cases—so I understand what’s really happening. I test steps myself because accuracy builds trust, and I ask SMEs direct, respectful questions to get the right details.

    I tailor content to the audience, keep jargon to a minimum, and update documentation as the product evolves. To me, documentation is part of the product: it should reduce friction, improve adoption, and give users confidence.

??? quote "Ultra Maritime | Technical Writer | April 2015 - July 2017"
    **Overview**  
    I joined Ultra Maritime as their first technical writer, supporting engineering teams developing marine defence technology for government and NATO clients. Much of the documentation was written by technologists and senior engineers, and the review burden had become unsustainable for the Chief Technology Director. My role was to bring consistency, structure, and editorial quality to a high-volume, highly technical document stream while navigating strict security, formatting, and compliance standards.

    **What I Did**  
    I began by reviewing and editing engineering documents for clarity, grammar, structure, terminology, and adherence to corporate templates—work that significantly reduced the time senior reviewers spent correcting basic writing issues. I ensured all documents were properly formatted, registered, numbered, and prepared for the formal document control workflow.

    Some engineers were initially hesitant about adding a writer into the process. To address this, I created and delivered a short presentation to clarify my role, reassure authors about technical accuracy, and outline how I could support them without disrupting their workflow. This helped build trust and ultimately strengthened collaboration.

    As the role evolved, I wrote additional procedures for the manufacturing floor and supported a wide range of document types, including test plans, test reports, preventative maintenance tasks, user manuals, and specifications. Because the work was tied to defence contracts, the role required obtaining and maintaining NATO Secret security clearance.

    **Highlights** 

     - Served as Ultra Maritime’s first technical writer, improving clarity, consistency, and structure across engineering documentation.  
    - Reduced senior engineering review time by correcting grammar, formatting, terminology, and style early in the process.  
    - Contributed to meeting project milestones and client delivery deadlines; praised for attention to detail and providing “excellent value.”  
    - Built relationships with initially hesitant engineers through clear communication and a supportive, collaborative approach.  
    - Supported diverse document types, from test reports to user manuals, maintenance procedures, and specifications.  
    - Required and held NATO Secret security clearance for defence-related documentation and workflows.  

??? quote "Caterpillar | Technical Writer | July 2008 - March 2015"

    **Overview**  
    I joined Caterpillar as the first and only technical writer in a small engineering group that had just been acquired. The team worked on mining technology for open-pit operations: surface drill systems, onboard displays, and equipment integrations used on some of the largest loading and hauling machines in Caterpillar’s fleet. The team was also transitioning from a “garage-style” engineering culture to enterprise-level processes, and almost no formal product documentation existed. My role was to create the entire product documentation set from the ground up while learning Caterpillar’s standards, tools, and publishing practices.

    **What I Did**  
    I worked closely with engineering SMEs to understand the hardware, electrical systems, and evolving product designs behind Caterpillar’s surface drill technology. Because the products were early in development, I relied heavily on schematics, 3D models, and hands-on time in the engineering lab to piece together accurate installation workflows.

    I produced detailed manuals that combined step-by-step procedures, routing instructions, safety considerations, BOM details, and annotated visuals. This meant learning how every bracket, cable, and connector fit into the system—and updating documentation constantly as designs changed. I became the point of contact with Caterpillar’s corporate publishing group, ensuring all documentation aligned with enterprise standards.

    The work extended into the field as well. I validated procedures at Caterpillar’s Tucson Proving Ground in Arizona and supported proof of concept installations at a mine site in northern Alberta—experiences that deepened my understanding of how technicians actually performed and would use the content.

    **Highlights**  

    - Created a complete library of 7+ installation and operator manuals where none previously existed.  
    - Produced accurate, engineering-aligned documentation for multiple drill models with varying mechanical and electrical configurations.  
    - Developed high-quality visuals using DSLR photography, image editing, and curated 3D engineering assets.  
    - Supported field validation at Tucson Proving Ground and documentation of on-site prototype installations in northern Alberta.  
    - Became the requested writer for three additional product groups after early documentation success.  
    - Received notable praise from the original founder of the engineering firm acquired by Caterpillar, after reading my drill operator's manual cover-to-cover:  
      *“This is perfect—amazing. I built the system and still learned things from your manual.”*
