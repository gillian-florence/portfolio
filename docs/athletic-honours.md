# Athletic Honours & Recognition

Before transitioning into tech, I was a proud member of the Canadian Women’s National Rugby Team for nearly two decades. My experiences as a high-performance athlete continue to influence my values of discipline, teamwork, and excellence in everything I do.

## Athlete Mindset

I spent nearly two decades as a member of the Canadian women’s rugby team. Balancing elite training with full-time work taught me discipline, humility, and teamwork in a way that translates directly to my professional life. 
These qualities shape how I show up as a writer, collaborator, and teammate.

??? note "What that experience gave me"
    - A deep sense of accountability  
    - Comfort in high-pressure, fast-moving environments  
    - A team-first mindset  
    - The ability to stay coachable and open to feedback  
    - Resilience and focus during difficult situations
