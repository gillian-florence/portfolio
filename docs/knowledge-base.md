# Welcome to My Demo Help Center

This sample **Help Center** was designed and built entirely in **Salesforce**, using the **Experience Cloud** site framework. It showcases how Knowledge Articles can be organized and surfaced through Topics, Featured Topics, and intuitive navigation to provide a scalable and user-friendly support solution.

On the backend, configuration was done in **Salesforce Setup** to manage:

- Knowledge object settings and page layouts  
- Article types and visibility controls  
- Topic management  
- Site branding and navigation structure
